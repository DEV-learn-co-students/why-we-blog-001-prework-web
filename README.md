 ## A Short and Happy Story about Blogging
 
 Tracy Lum maintained a technical blog while she was a student and TA at Flatiron. When Tracy applied to be a developer at Rent the Runway, her future employers checked out her <a href="http://talum.github.io/">awesome blog</a> and were like, 'Wow--awesome blog! No need to give her a code challenge; Let's hire this way smart person!!'
  
 ## What you need to do
